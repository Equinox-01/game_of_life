# Game of Life

This is a Ruby implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Description

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Installation

1. Install Shoes: `gem install shoes --pre`
2. Run the game: `shoes life.rb`

## Controls

There are no controls for this game. The initial pattern of cells determines the evolution of the game.
